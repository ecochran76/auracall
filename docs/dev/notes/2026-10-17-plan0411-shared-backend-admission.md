# Plan0411 shared backend admission repair

State: source repair; production activation and live acceptance pending.
Base: f88e8f468 on fix/plan0411-follow-discovery, draft PR333. Primary serial.

## Defect and scope

The shared ledger already aggregated backend request permits by provider/account,
including independent process instances. Live-follow did not supply backend
admission to its traffic governor. Utility and provider-client authorities accepted
only an explicit internal limit; service configuration could not enable them.
Browser-operation admission and reactive shared warnings did not establish a
shared backend request budget. The earlier125-request measurement covered one
owned target, not aggregate account traffic; concurrent work prevents assigning
the observed429 to live-follow alone.

Added services.chatgpt.maxBackendRequestsPerMinute and the runtime binding override
runtimeProfiles.<name>.services.chatgpt.maxBackendRequestsPerMinute. The explicit
positive-safe-integer setting is consumed by all three configured authority paths.
No default or chosen production ceiling. Caller-supplied utility/factory limits
retain their existing precedence. Existing ledger scope, request identity,
interception and warning behavior are reused. Live-follow validates exact current
lease custody on request dispatch and reconciles request effects before settlement;
unknown request effects cannot report successful completion.

Coverage is owned intercepted ChatGPT /backend-api/ traffic, including bootstrap
before navigation. It is not browser-wide observation of manual tabs, unobserved
workers, bypassing clients or every HTTP path. Exhaustion follows existing bounded
yield/stop behavior; no automatic wait/retry or warning dismissal was introduced.

## Feedback loops and verification

- Public configured live-follow boundary: two tasks, independent file-backed
  ledger instances, same account, fixture ceiling1. Before wiring both lack the
  admission hook; after wiring exactly one request dispatch succeeds, the other
  receives ProviderBackendRequestBudgetExceededError. Initial fixture setup failure
  was corrected before retaining the red-capable run.
- Existing owned-transport and public utility bootstrap tests now enable admission
  through service config rather than explicit limit arguments. All18selected cases
  failed before utility/factory wiring and passed afterward (22.10seconds).
- Unknown-outcome regression: temporarily removing the final success guard makes
  the public completion incorrectly resolve; restoring it rejects completion.
  Mutation was restored in a finally block. No mutation remains in source.
- Resolver cases cover opt-in, global fallback, runtime precedence and malformed
  explicit ceilings. No numeric fixture value is a production recommendation.

Commands: pnpm vitest run tests/accountMirror/configuredLiveFollowAffinity.test.ts
-t 'two owned tasks' (original red/green test name); pnpm vitest run
 tests/browser/backendRequestAdmission.test.ts -t 'owned backend denial|public utility bootstrap'.
The final follow test is named 'owned follow request admission preserves %s'.

Affected provider-free selection:9files236tests pass in54.16seconds, including
refresh service, actual metadata collector, utility, transport, ledger, governor
and tenant configuration. Final changed boundary rerun:2files23tests pass.
Final typecheck and touched-source/test lint pass. No full-suite, build, installed
runtime, browser-wide coverage or native acceptance claim.

These local logs are locators; retained source tests and this result summary are
the repository evidence. No private provider payloads were added.

## Review and remaining acceptance

Standards reviewed serially against f88e8f468 and current repository conventions:
reuse existing owned authority and ledger; no new parallel budget store or aliases.
Spec reviewed separately against the authorized shared-task regression and repair:
shared admission is enabled consistently by explicit configuration; known denial
blocks dispatch, unknown outcome cannot report success. No accepted blocking
findings. Live acceptance remains incomplete; the previous retained429stop is not
cleared by passing provider-free tests. Choose a measured ceiling, stage the full
runtime and establish shared participating-task evidence before claiming it active.
Issue165 remains closed; Plan0411/P92 remains open. No scheduler, launcher,
service, live warning or other browser-task state was changed in this repair.

Memory disposition: forbidden; no explicit user authorization to update memory.


## Operator-authorized concurrent retry preparation (2026-10-18)

The operator requested LitScout tabs16/36 retry concurrently with live-follow.
Both exact threads acknowledged through native Wake delivery and wrote readiness
receipts under /tmp/plan0411-peer-retry-20261018. Mailbox sends were rejected
store_unavailable with no admission; native intents were admitted once, not blind
retries of uncertain effects. Both use fresh installed CLI apps list on runtime
wsl-chrome-3; no new prompt budget is inferred or consumed. Runtime release is
owned by this lane.

Immediate budget denial would safely stop these tests rather than complete them.
Added explicit backendRequestBudgetWaitMs (default0), reusing atomic shared
permits after capacity returns. Waiting sends no provider requests, checks
warnings/lease/cancellation each second, and is bounded. It computes the next
rolling-window release instead of repeatedly creating rejected ledger entries.
App inventory deadlines include configured waiting; injected short deadlines
remain unchanged. Three caller regression fails before the change and passes
across successive minute windows afterward. Warning, cancellation and timeout
cases retain hard stops. Affected138tests/6files pass; typecheck/lint pass.
Full rebuilt installation and live three-workload acceptance are pending.

Fresh passive readiness at00:04UTC verified native browser identity, complete DOM,
no visible blocking surface, and an expired legacy cooldown. The retained shared
warning dates22:02UTC; warning history/frozen records are preserved. Any qualified
operator retry release will be recorded with exact scope and reason. Trial
ceiling30backend requests/minute and bounded600000ms capacity waiting are proposed
for this authorized measured run, not a claim about provider capacity.


## Installed-boundary correction before release

Staged520125ff2 matched584JavaScript files and built successfully, but actual
resolveConfig stripped both new service fields: caller tests injected typed
objects and missed the schema boundary. Activation stopped before warning release
or launcher promotion; the proposed config fields had been written but were
ineffective in that old schema. Original config backup remains private and intact.
Added both fields to ChatgptServiceConfigSchema. A real-resolver regression fails
with an empty service object before the fix and passes with global values and
runtime binding precedence afterward. Affected schema/config selection42tests
passes. Replacement full build/install and exact resolved config verification are
required before releasing either LitScout peer.


## Native trial result and rollback — 2026-10-18

Source d3abdada9 was fully built/installed,584compiled JavaScript files matched,
and actual resolved configuration confirmed30backend requests/minute with600000ms
bounded waiting. CLI/MCP wrappers selected it for this trial. Main API94853 and
its paused scheduler were not restarted or resumed. The previous22:02rate warning
was explicitly released after the qualified expired-cooldown/native-DOM readback;
its history and all frozen records were retained.

The two prepared peers each acknowledged the release, verified installed identity
and ran exactly one fresh installed apps list on wsl-chrome-3. Both returned their
file-only results, which the coordinator read. Neither sent a prompt, restarted
a browser, cleared a warning or retried. Each failed with
OwnedBackendRequestCleanupError: owned backend request client cleanup timed out
during getProviderSessionProof/readState. Tab16 ran00:09:38–00:10:07UTC; tab36 ran
00:10:25–00:11:02UTC. This is failed inventory acceptance, not download evidence.

The one installed private proof-server follow attempt failed00:09:04UTC after
about4.45seconds at desktop admission: Desktop control is busy; automation or
another human owns the display. It sent0backend requests and completed0passes.
Fresh later gate-owner readback was empty; no permanent owner or causal attribution
is inferred. No follow lease remained in the exact parent readback. No owned CLI
or proof-server process remained after the terminal results; shared browser20905
was retained. No blanket tab cleanup, custody reset or process signal occurred.

Aggregate ledger meter00:08:55–00:11:44UTC observed34new owned backend permits,
31started, peak29started admissions per rolling minute,7settled and1explicitly
unknown effect; other started records remained unresolved and were not rewritten.
Two distinct utility operations participated. There were0new active shared
provider warnings. This is account-wide owned-permit evidence, not full HTTP
coverage or proof of no429 anywhere. The selected ceiling was not exhausted,
so native waiting behavior is not qualified by this run. The three attempts did
not overlap after asynchronous dispatch and early failure; simultaneous three-way
acceptance remains untested. Provider-free waiting/atomic-budget regressions do
not substitute for that native evidence.

Acceptance failed. At00:12:02UTC, exact unchanged-current config/wrapper checks
qualified rollback to the original config bytes and prior issue331 launcher
selection. d3abdada9 remains staged only. No shared budget is claimed globally
active after rollback. No warning history was erased or reintroduced, and no
frozen/uncertain records were settled manually. Operational end notices were scheduled for both peers; scheduling admission does
not prove receipt. The notices prohibit another automatic attempt. Original provider prompt/call
budgets remain unchanged. No provider retry after uncertain cleanup.

Private receipts: ~/.auracall/diagnostics/plan0411/shared-trial-activation/
(receipt.json, warning-release.json, config-before.json, rollback.json),
shared-retry-readiness.json, and

Peer/meter receipts: /tmp/plan0411-peer-retry-20261018/{tab16-result.json,
tab36-result.json,aggregate-latest.json,checkpoint.json}. Request and terminal
native Wake receipts are in the same private coordination directory.

Remaining blocker: reproduce actual native desktop-command/transport hold and
owned-request cleanup composition with provider-free fixtures before another
installed provider attempt. Do not weaken ownership, cleanup or rate guards.
Plan0411/P92 stays OPEN; issue165 stays closed. Memory disposition remains forbidden.


## Renewed actual-test retry: ledger write amplification

Operator corrected inventory-only scope and renewed the actual qualification
retry. Both peer preparations now name their real connector/delivery acceptance;
app inventory is only an intermediate step. One bounded actual test retry is
being coordinated; no test-success claim is made during preparation.

Installed scoped tracing retained the cleanup failure and measured individual
admissions taking11–17seconds. The real ledger snapshot was15,307,276bytes with
3,778records and11,375events. Each reserve/start/settle rewrote and fsynced the
entire snapshot independently, multiplying local disk work during a background
request burst. A simple13-request synthetic browser burst on an empty ledger
already passed; it was an exploratory elimination, not a red claim.

Public ledger regression goes red at13durable replacements against the one-burst
write budget. File-backed callers now coalesce queued mutations under the same
cross-process lock, load once and publish results only after one durable commit.
A failed operation/commit aborts that batch without returning uncommitted results.
Normal denied admissions remain recorded and account ceilings/warnings unchanged.
Cross-process lock authority, fsync/atomic replacement and full history remain;
no history pruning, warning clearing or cleanup deadline increase.

Private isolated copies of the real15MB history replayed13reserve/start/settle
sequences: original8,084ms versus batched633ms,13allowed and13settled in each.
No live ledger or provider state was changed by this replay. Private source-copy
receipts stay in /tmp/plan0411-ledger-history-replay-result.json and its recorded
0700directory. Existing affected84tests pass; final ledger durability19tests pass.
Blocked-commit and failed-commit cases prove no permits escape before persistence.
Source/native acceptance remains separate; build/staged retry is next.


## Native verification burst follow-up

Installed ab2dc0750 tracing still reported the owned cleanup timeout; batching
alone did not establish native acceptance. A separate13-way current native
verification measurement took3,373ms. These simultaneous exact-generation checks
repeated the same serialized Remote View window query. Coalesce only the live
unfinished verifyNativeBrowser promise for the full native binding generation;
remove it on success/failure. Retain no completed result or time-based PID/window
cache. Current stored generation/process/boot/executable/window checks remain.

Expanded actual scrubbed-process test goes red at13window requests instead of1;
after the fix it passes and a later changed-generation observation is rejected.
Native process/CDP/human-control selection4tests/3files passes. The same current
13-way observation after coalescing takes353ms and verifies all13callers. Existing
ownership refusal, human exclusion and fresh post-settlement checks remain intact.
Both fixes require installed requalification; no native success claim yet.

## Transport-owned capacity cancellation (2026-10-18)

Installed d9f9be89c still failed cleanup after ledger/native optimizations.
Transport disposal waited for admissions sleeping on capacity (up to60seconds)
under a10second cleanup bound.3339706e8 passes an operation cancellation signal
through the governor to admission, cancels pre-dispatch waits on disposal, drains
paused Fetch callbacks before disabling interception and leaves dispatched failure
uncertain. No ceiling or timeout was raised. Governor reuse is not poisoned by
proven pre-dispatch cancellation.

Exact regression: observe a real capacity denial under ceiling1, close transport
and prove waiting request fails without dispatch and desktop custody releases.
Before patch: cleanup still waiting for capacity. After:245ms focused case;
67affected transport tests pass. Five authority cases pass including cancellation
after dispatch retaining outcome-unknown. Typecheck, full build and final compile
pass. Installed3339706e8:584compiled JavaScript files match, zero mismatches.
Private installed cleanup observation and actual concurrent qualification remain
pending; prior native failure is retained.

The installed3339706e8 check drained waits but found reserved-before-start
cancellation: ledger.settle requires started. A new exact regression fails with
"Backend dispatch and settlement failed" before repair. Final admission records
the start before checking cancellation and settles none without dispatch; ordinary
start/lease failures retain the prior behavior. Existing failed native receipt is
retained at /tmp/plan0411-cancelled-cleanup-trace.jsonl.

Installed5b4fa7a9e also retained settlement-time ordering failures: actual
reserved/start/settled timestamps move backward. An injected backward clock
reproduces settlement rejection. Authority-local nondecreasing timestamps retain
conservative account counting and ordered transitions; seven authority cases pass.
Fetch-domain teardown failures remain unqualified live evidence.

## Actual qualification release failed (2026-10-18)

Activated installedde15e41c9 at00:50:33UTC, both global CLI/MCP wrappers and
resolved ceiling30/rollingminute, capacity wait600000ms;584compiledJS match.
No warning release, main API restart or scheduler resume. Exact activation and
rollback receipts are under ~/.auracall/diagnostics/plan0411/actual-trial-de15e41c9.

Both peers received actual apps test --submit requests. Tab36 launched00:52:00
and failed00:52:26 with OwnedBackendRequestCleanupError cleanup timeout. Tab16
first failed local required-account parsing with zero provider effect; corrected
--expected-account run00:52:46–00:53:10 failed the same cleanup timeout during
getProviderSessionProof/readState. No connector invocation or delivered artifact
bytes qualified. Prompt effects remain conservatively unknown pending exact
invocation reconciliation; no provider prompt was automatically resubmitted.

Live-follow parent acctmirror_completion_cf1f1739-393c-43b2-86f6-d14576bbadf5
ran during tab36, failed desktop-control admission with0backend requests,0passes.
No successful three-way overlap; corrected tab16 ran later. Native browser PID
20905/CDP45015 was freshly verified before activation, not trusted from static
records. No browser process was killed or custody record reset.

Aggregate observed39ledger start transitions:28settled effect-none cancellations
were proven not dispatched,11settled dispatches. Peak charged dispatches11/min
under ceiling30;0active shared warnings. Raw first meter wrongly counted canceled
starts as dispatches (peak39); preserved original receipt and corrected accounting
exclude effect-none cancellations. These are owned permit observations, not full
HTTP/no429 proof. Logs/results remain private under /tmp/plan0411-endtoend-20261018.

Trial rolled back00:53:41UTC with exact wrapper/config hash checks; baseline
issue331-d03d89e38816 restored, staged runtime retained, API PID94853 unchanged.
Source73affected tests plus final8focused tests, typecheck/build/compile/lint are
source evidence only. Installed acceptance FAILED; Plan0411/P92 stays open and
PR333 remains draft. Next target is native owned-transport cleanup and desktop
contention; no more inventory-only acceptance or unqualified provider retry.
Memory disposition forbidden: no explicit user memory-write request.

## Diagnose and separate cleanup deadline phases (2026-10-18)

A fresh installedde15e41c9 read-only trace reproduces owned cleanup failure.
The exact current adapter close deadline is3000ms (earlier notes described10s,
which is the utility settlement bound). Native admission/draining lasted5–7s;
Fetch wire replies2–10ms and physical socket close4ms. The outer3s bound was
covering all phases rather than only disconnect. Trace is private at
/tmp/plan0411-phase-cleanup-trace.jsonl; no prompt or connector effects.

Owned client wrappers now time the physical disconnect themselves after draining;
only those tagged exact client objects bypass the adapter outer timer. Other
clients retain the old bound. Cancellation and Fetch.disable wire commands keep
3s bounds after mandatory admission. Proven pre-dispatch cancellation tolerates
Chrome Invalid InterceptionId (resource already gone); dispatch failures and
other protocol errors remain uncertainty.

Regression blocks real admission to Fetch.disable beyond3s and proves cleanup
does not falsely settle or time out before admission completes. Red observed on
old scope;69affected tests pass before final per-wire wrapper addition. Existing
physical disconnect stalls still fail with the precise socket-timeout reason.
Installed validation and native desktop contention repair remain pending.

## Cancellable automation admission queue (2026-10-18)

Native desktop gate retries another automation owner100times20ms, then returns
busy. New red fixture holds actual ownership beyond3s: a cancellable contender
fails before release. Forward the caller abort signal through guarded CDP command
admission and owned continuous-hold acquisition. The gate waits for automation
until caller cancellation; signal-less callers retain the existing short bound.
Human control and invalid ownership still refuse; arbitrary I/O errors are not
reclassified as contention. Exact native generation checks remain after admission.

Red observed, then14boundary tests across4files pass: real native WebSocket command
waits3s behind another owner, then runs under unchanged100ms wire deadline; queued
cancellation dispatches nothing and preserves the first owner; current native PID/
process/window generation and human exclusion cases remain green. Typecheck/lint
pass; no stale PID cleanup or forced release.

Installed62be28fb6 cleanup-only read now completes: both physical disconnects2–6ms
and no owned cleanup exception. It reported an empty app inventory, so this is a
cleanup-path result, not actual qualification acceptance. Full combined install and
actual peer/follow trial pending.

Final queue transport selection:70tests in2files pass (64.82s), plus14native
boundary tests. Incremental production compile and typecheck pass; touched lint
reports no warnings. One guarded auth presence request returned200, authenticated
and matching configured account; no credential captured. Prior de15e41c9 peer
failures reconcile to initial await readState at compiled CLI line180, before any
submitTest branch; their earlier unknown prompt classification was conservative,
and source plus exact stacks establish no submitted prompt from those attempts.

## 2026-10-18 — Actual retry returned HTTP 429; admission gaps repaired in source

The ca2e264b2 trial failed. Live-follow failed desktop admission with zero backend
requests; tab36 failed the outer operation mutex; tab16 was interrupted after an
unguarded inventory/submission path was discovered. Its prompt outcome remains
unknown and must not be resubmitted. A real shared HTTP429 warning was observed at
01:21:19.752UTC. Trial wrappers/config were restored at01:23:24.718UTC. The meter's
30 canceled ledger starts do not measure all HTTP traffic and prove no compliance.
Evidence: /tmp/plan0411-cleanup-queue-20261018 and shared-admission note.

Source repairs attach admission to developer-app inventory sockets and normal
native/legacy prompt governors, propagate unknown cleanup failures, queue the
existing CLI operation mutex, and create guarded prompt targets blank before
interception/navigation. Backend reconciliation excludes only the enclosing prompt
reservation, preserving unfinished-action fencing. Installed acceptance remains
failed; no provider retry or warning clearance is authorized by these source checks.

Final source validation:170tests/8files pass; typecheck, full build, targeted
Biome check and diff check pass. New source remains uninstalled. Native terminal
notices accepted for tabs16/36; acknowledgment/execution not yet observed.
Memory disposition forbidden; /tmp/plan0411-ca2-closeout-memory.json.

## 2026-10-18 — Live-follow admission diagnosis: nearby red is not the live defect

Applied diagnosing-bugs against source f46833bf2. Provider-free public session-proof
harness with the real desktop gate and guarded CDP: uncontended proof succeeds;
3s contention succeeds; no-signal persistent contention fails repeatedly in
3.26–4.17s with Desktop control busy at enableChatgptTargetDomains. With a caller
abort signal,6s contention succeeds in6.14s. The live collector already passes
its timeout signal, so the no-signal failure is not a proven reproduction of the
live defect. No production fix or passing live claim follows from this result.

Canonical proof command (temporary fixture):
`pnpm vitest run tests/browser/backendRequestAdmission.test.ts -t 'live-follow session proof'`.
Logs: /tmp/plan0411-proof-repro-{contended,no-signal,long-owner,minimal,real-signal}.log.
Prototype retained only in /tmp/plan0411-proof-admission-debug; production tests
restored exactly. No provider requests, browser restarts, warning clearances or
resubmissions. Existing live receipt lacks the failing command/call stack and gate
owner identity. Diagnosis stops before a speculative fix; exact live call-boundary
evidence remains needed after the active429 is resolved. Plan0411/P92 stays OPEN.
Memory disposition forbidden: no explicit memory-write request.

## 2026-10-18 — Session-proof cancellation survives domain setup

Targeted provider-free tracing now reproduces Desktop control busy even when the
public session-proof call has an abort signal: Page.enable/Runtime.enable carry
it, subsequent Runtime.evaluate calls do not. Introduce automation contention at
the identity read after setup; the public proof rejects in2.53s. Scope caller
cancellation through the proof's provider observation so later CDP admission
receives it. Explicit wire scopes keep their deadlines and combine cancellation
with the caller signal. Proof-only retained-session cleanup remains outside that
scope. Focused wait/cancel/human-control cases pass; guarded cancellation also
checks the native-style held-admission path and released custody.

Evidence: /tmp/plan0411-post-setup-minimal-red.log,
/tmp/plan0411-post-setup-red-trace.json, /tmp/plan0411-post-setup-green.log;
original first-probe loop rerun green at
/tmp/plan0411-proof-original-loop-green.log. Temporary file tracing removed;
only in-memory metadata assertions remain. This reproduces the symptom when no
continuous backend-request hold is active, not yet the exact installed ca2 trial.
That trial's configured guard/owner interaction still requires live evidence.
No provider calls or warning clearances; installed three-workload acceptance OPEN.

Focused validation:93tests across7files pass (not the full suite); final4public
proof cases pass after replacing private fixture assertions with custody behavior.
Typecheck, targeted lint, full build and diff check pass. The original broader
first-probe loop also passes. No debug logging remains in production source.
Read-only warning refresh at02:41:49UTC retains the original indefinite429.
Memory disposition forbidden (no user request); receipt
/tmp/plan0411-proof-signal-memory.json. Source is not installed.

The wrapper in configuredLiveFollowAffinity starts its timer before CDP admission;
its timing boundary is the next provider-free investigation, not a completed fix.
No live retry. Main API healthy, scheduler paused,19paused subscriptions preserved,

The next regression must combine active interceptor ownership with the separate
warning client; candidate repair is reuse of the existing admitted client/scope.
No source fix is claimed by this evidence packet.

Main remains healthy with19paused subscriptions,0queued/running,0active provider
warnings. No warning release was needed for this retry; prior explicit release
and all frozen histories remain. Completion wake cancelled after foreground
consumption. Durable phase/acceptance receipts and runnable tracing harness:

Plan0411/P92 remains OPEN. No additional live retry.
