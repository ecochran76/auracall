# Aura-Call

Aura-Call coordinates model requests through configured provider accounts and browser runtimes while preserving explicit identity, execution, and artifact ownership.

Developer-app inventory diagnostics retain browser resolution, utility/interaction
admission, identity, attachment, inventory, Developer mode, navigation restoration
and cleanup stages. Queue admission precedes the operation and has its own bound.
The effective inventory deadline includes configured backend capacity waiting.
A visible main-page account-load failure ends installed inventory observation with
`developer_app_account_load_error`; sidebar/hidden text is not failure evidence.
Plugins Add is a dropdown/combo. A disabled control permits one pre-form refresh,
with exact account continuity and fresh readiness checks; missing identity or a
still unavailable control stops creation. No recovery wraps form input/submission.
Passive assistant progress includes plain prose owned by the qualified assistant
turn when a provider omits its markdown wrapper. Descendant content remains
preferred; tool/composer exclusions and response boundaries still apply. Snapshot
text, passive progress, completion, terminal deadline and later recovery evidence
are separate observations. A later completed answer cannot prove pre-deadline
completion.

App list reads use inventory-only observation and do not navigate Developer mode
settings; unobserved Developer mode remains unknown. Mutation checks are separate.
A failure receipt does not establish transport cleanup or authorize retries.

Provider-interaction ledger observations share the same-instance operation queue
with mutations. Concurrent reads share a locked snapshot; pure reads never
rewrite it. Mixed-batch results publish only after durable commit. Cross-process
locking, complete history and warning/ownership fences remain authoritative.
CLI stage diagnostics preserve original error identity and aggregate causes.
App failure receipts project bounded, sanitized cause/aggregate trees without
serializing stacks or request objects; unknown cleanup retains its refusal.
Long app-list waits retain stage progress on stderr even without verbose mode;
JSON stdout remains terminal-only. Reported budget is an allowance, not proof
of capacity denial or a changed deadline.
Identical concurrent tab-custody lists share only an unfinished observation,
with separate caller clones; completed custody state is never cached.
Active utility operations renew tab-owner liveness every 30 seconds through
provider work and cleanup. A heartbeat advances the fenced claim without changing
last meaningful use or the absolute deadline. Renewal and local ownership checks
are serialized. Expired/lost claims or storage failure abort work; failed renewal
cannot revive ownership during final settlement. Idle operations stop renewing.
Budget-wait cancellation includes already-aborted timer entry after asynchronous
ledger reads; proven-unsent cancellation must not poison later admission.

Backend warning probes belong to the request's own live transport. Native
cancellation/document replacement only releases pre-send work when the guarded
transport proves the SDK send was not invoked; post-send uncertainty remains
fenced. Inventory observation includes configured capacity waiting for the
installed-app response, then separately bounds optional linked metadata. Caller
abort ends observation and prevents later navigation; outer deadlines remain.

Warning-frozen interaction settlement reports the existing provider-warning admission stop; it never converts the frozen record to settled or clears the warning. Other invalid settlement states remain errors.

## Language

**AuraCall runtime profile**:
A named Aura-Call configuration entry that selects execution defaults and provider bindings for one operator context.
_Avoid_: Profile, runtime config

**Browser profile**:
A browser-runtime and account-family configuration referenced by an AuraCall runtime profile.
_Avoid_: Profile, Chrome profile

**Source browser profile**:
A native Chromium profile used only as the source for bootstrap state such as cookies.
_Avoid_: Browser profile, managed profile

**Managed browser profile**:
An Aura-Call-owned browser state directory used for automation.
_Avoid_: Source profile, user profile

**Provider binding**:
The provider-specific account, target, model, and workflow defaults selected for an AuraCall runtime profile.
_Avoid_: Service binding, provider config

**Browser launch plan**:
The fully resolved, immutable description of one browser launch, including its browser profile, managed browser profile, provider binding, and launch policy. For user-config launch fields, explicit runtime browser overrides precede browser-profile settings and configured global defaults. Source identity and opt-in copying remain separate from managed browser identity.
_Avoid_: Browser config, launch profile

**Provider prompt**:
One requested model interaction routed through a provider binding, including its target, attachments, completion posture, and progress evidence.
_Avoid_: Browser prompt, request

**Browser operation**:
One authorized browser action or read. A single operation may cause several
provider backend requests; its budget is distinct from their budget. Command-response deadlines start after required desktop admission; total workflow elapsed time still includes coordination and remains subject to caller cancellation. Provider-session observations retain caller cancellation for subsequent CDP admission after domain setup; proof-session cleanup has separate custody. Cancellable desktop admission may wait behind other automation; human control still pauses automation immediately.

**Provider backend request permit**:
An account-wide admission reservation for one uniquely identified backend request
from an owned provider client. Repeated observations of the same request do not
create another permit. A permit is not proof of a completed provider response. Once owned interception shutdown begins, queued request callbacks join that shutdown outcome rather than sending further Fetch commands. A failed shutdown remains a cleanup failure.
Admission snapshots distinguish ready request flow, known budget exhaustion,
unqualified failures and provider warnings. Collection may yield for known budget
exhaustion; uncertainty or a provider warning requires a hard stop.

A configured authority factory reports `backendRequestAdmissionEnabled` when its
new authorities admit backend requests. This is cleanup capability metadata, not
lease authority. Cancellation callers resolve options before reading and respect
an explicit governor ahead of factory metadata; they never borrow a governor or
acquire a target lease merely to inspect this capability.

**Materialization attempt**:
One bounded effort to turn a selected provider asset into a verified local artifact and durable receipt.
_Avoid_: Download attempt, materialization run

**Acceptance run**:
A bounded provider-specific verification workflow that produces operator-readable evidence about an Aura-Call behavior.
_Avoid_: Smoke, acceptance script

**Viewer download control**:
A download action outside the conversation-turn cards, used after a selected artifact opens its preview. Generic inline `Download file` labels do not establish viewer authority.

**Artifact cache reuse**:
A local conversation attachment matching a currently discovered artifact ID, filename and URI. Readability, size and any retained checksum are checked before reuse. New transfer budget excludes reused artifacts; explicit force bypasses reuse. Context refresh alone does not force transfer. A requested fresh context read must succeed before artifact materialization; provider failure cannot silently authorize cached download controls. Explicit refresh=false can use cached context.

**Scoped reconciliation reuse**:
For an explicit conversation batch, archive availability is filtered to those provider conversations before file inspection and retains the recorded checksum. Full checksum refresh cannot authorize reuse; if retained evidence cannot be read independently, the asset stays eligible for recovery. A current asset-family match may reuse a same-account archive file only after regular-file, stable-size/mtime and checksum verification. The result includes a duplicate entry, actual bytes/hash and existing archive/asset links. Reuse does not count as a new transfer; force bypasses it. Missing or corrupt files remain eligible for recovery. Explicit non-retryable provider-unavailability evidence from a settled same-account, single-conversation job is returned as a skipped entry with its original reason and priorEvidenceJobId when its current asset family matches. Ambiguous batches do not qualify; force bypasses the projection.

**Unloaded crawler target**:
A newly created blank crawler target, or a process-owned retained blank explicitly verified during acquisition with known effects. Only that acquisition can authorize the collector's initial governed navigation. Blank target creation uses generic acquisition pacing; provider page navigation keeps its renavigation cooldown. Other retained pages keep preservation semantics.

**Conversation route identity**:
A root ChatGPT conversation URL may canonicalize into its project URL. Navigation settling and ready-surface reuse follow the exact conversation identity and origin; an explicitly requested project must also match.

**Recovery archive evidence**:
Historical archive availability reduces current missing-asset counts only when its canonical catalog-item locator, provider, AuraCall runtime profile, tenant and asset kind match a current catalog row. Repeated archive copies of the same catalog item count once. Account-wide archive totals do not prove availability of a newly observed asset.

**Provider session custody**:
A retained browser session must have a reachable caller owner. A proof-only read closes a session created on its private options; it preserves a session supplied by the caller. Deadline-scoped conversation reads and explicit-target utility wrappers return retained-session custody to their session-enabled caller.

**Provider response activity**:
The observed running response or pending tool approval on a provider page. This can differ from lease effect state after an external/CDP submission. TTL cleanup must not infer provider inactivity from a settled lease; active or unknown ChatGPT activity preserves its tab.
**AuraCall remote-view client**:
An operator-facing application view dedicated to AuraCall's owned desktops and managed browsers.
_Avoid_: Root desktop, source browser profile

**Root desktop display**:
The general desktop view available independently of the AuraCall remote-view client.
_Avoid_: AuraCall remote-view client

**AuraCall desktop**:
A desktop owned by AuraCall that houses its controlled browsers, identified by a neutral label such as Desktop 1. Desktops have no dedicated task purpose; browser profiles and accounts identify the browsers inside them.
_Avoid_: Browser profile, AuraCall runtime profile, research desktop, writing desktop

**Browser Recall**:
An operator-confirmed return of a borrowed managed browser profile to AuraCall: close its identified external browser and launch the same profile under AuraCall. Profile data is retained.
_Avoid_: Profile reset, desktop reassignment

**Control handoff**:
An explicit transfer of interaction ownership between automation and a human operator.
_Avoid_: View selection, browser launch

**Memory routing**:
The selection of a reviewed Graphiti group and audience for qualified source-backed memory. AuraCall uses `auracall_main`. Unresolved routing is distinct from a verified memory-service failure.


**Installed runtime**:
The user-scoped AuraCall package adopted from integrated source, with compiled
code identity and required application surfaces verified before promotion. Its
source commit is distinct from browser processes, browser profiles and the
package version, which alone cannot prove feature preservation.
_Avoid_: Version-only runtime identity

**Desktop control ownership record**:
The retained identity and role governing desktop interaction. Invalid or incomplete ownership preserves unknown custody and blocks interaction with recovery guidance. Atomic publication prevents partially written records from being exposed. Browser opening is independent of this interaction ownership.
The short coordination transition has its own immutable generation and process
identity. Proven-dead same-boot Linux transitions can be reclaimed once without
revoking human custody; ambiguous transitions remain blocked.

**Browser opening custody**:
The retained managed-profile process identity plus current desktop assignment that qualifies creation of a new tab/window. A current window cannot be a prerequisite for creating its replacement. Existing-page interaction separately requires current window proof and desktop input ownership.

**Cold-start browser handoff**:
The creation and lease qualification of a replacement page before retiring the selected incompatible startup page. This preserves the browser lifetime and keeps replacement custody explicit when retirement fails.

**App composer qualification**:
The unique visible enabled ChatGPT rich editor owned by the composer and outside dialogs, recognized by either legacy ID or current data-composer-markdown/Ask ChatGPT shape. Missing or ambiguous qualification blocks input; app identity is read from this editor, not an unrelated page pill.

**App mention option**:
A qualified visible enabled picker row for the installed app. Current rows require its exact name and description to exclude same-name custom GPTs; the chosen composer pill must then prove the exact plugin identity before Send.

**Selected app mention identity**:
The exact installed app identifier retained by its composer pill, using legacy plugin attributes or a current complete app:// URI. Presence or display name alone does not authorize Send; malformed or multiple mentions do not qualify.

**Startup close confirmation**:
A bounded observation of the exact selected startup target disappearing after one close request. Acknowledgment is not physical-removal proof; uncertain confirmation preserves replacement custody.

Developer-app submitted tests have two custody phases: exact utility inventory read and settlement, then shared submission lifecycle tab acquisition. The app/account observation crosses this local handoff; shared lifecycle still checks live account and canonical app identity before Send. Never nest submission acquisition under active inventory ownership or relax process ownership to permit it.

Leased browser endpoints retain service-qualified browser process identity and managed browser directory into provider-session authorization, bound to the exact leased target. The process owning a tab lease can be the CLI and is not evidence of the browser process.

Developer-app response collection uses the resolved browser launch policy deadline. Fresh-root Chat/current app-test posture does not replace the selected browser.timeoutMs. A timeout after Send preserves effect evidence and forbids automatic resubmission.

**Lease retirement audit**: durable history of AuraCall expiry-close intent and outcome, distinct from the mutable final lease snapshot. Acting process identity is distinct from browser process identity; already-missing is an observation, not proof of an AuraCall close.


**Native browser reconciliation**:
An explicit operator request to replace an exited native browser generation's
receipt with a currently qualified same-placement process. It proves current
process birth, executable, managed directory, desktop assignment/window and owned
loopback endpoint; it preserves the previous receipt, input-control claims and
managed data. It does not open a page, submit a prompt or infer outcome of an
unknown submission. Normal inventory never performs reconciliation implicitly.

Utility cold startup uses strict native browser absence proof before the shared
coordinator reconciles safe retained tab leases. Missing CDP alone never authorizes
lease release; unknown custody blocks startup.

Debugger readiness failure carries owned-child exit evidence when observed.
BROWSER_PROCESS_EXITED_BEFORE_CDP means an exit code or signal was observed;
BROWSER_CDP_NOT_READY preserves unknown exit attribution and grants no restart.

Read-only utility stale-lease reconciliation observes the exact managed browser
directory/service domain despite tenant metadata drift. Fresh adoption and provider
identity remain tenant-scoped; live-owner and uncertain-effect fences remain intact.


**Grok Connector**:
An external service connected to Grok through its Plugins connector surface,
including a custom MCP server. Its connected account and permissions are distinct
from a generated app or a Bot.

**Grok incremental index follow**:
Bounded fresh observations of visible Chats heads that retain completed backfill
and merge observed new or changed rows. A known row fingerprint bounds the
observed window; it does not establish global provider ordering or prove older
rows unchanged. An explicit full sweep covers that separate observation gap.
Relative-time labels supply filtering estimates, not stable update identity;
qualified absolute timestamps can establish observable date changes. History
windows own their bounded change evidence; supplemental mounted rows do not
refill an empty incremental frontier.

**Grok Bot**:
A named Grok agent with its own configuration that an operator can select for a
conversation. It is distinct from an AuraCall runtime profile or execution agent.

**Grok generated app**:
An app created through Grok Build mode. Generation, preview, artifact retrieval
and publication are distinct outcomes; a Connector is not a generated app.
