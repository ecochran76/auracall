# Aura-Call

Aura-Call coordinates model requests through configured provider accounts and browser runtimes while preserving explicit identity, execution, and artifact ownership.

## Language

**AuraCall runtime profile**:
A named Aura-Call configuration entry that selects execution defaults and provider bindings for one operator context.
_Avoid_: Profile, runtime config

**Browser profile**:
A browser-runtime and account-family configuration referenced by an AuraCall runtime profile.
_Avoid_: Profile, Chrome profile

**Source browser profile**:
A native Chromium profile used only as the source for bootstrap state such as cookies.
_Avoid_: Browser profile, managed profile

**Managed browser profile**:
An Aura-Call-owned browser state directory used for automation.
_Avoid_: Source profile, user profile

**Provider binding**:
The provider-specific account, target, model, and workflow defaults selected for an AuraCall runtime profile.
_Avoid_: Service binding, provider config

**Browser launch plan**:
The fully resolved, immutable description of one browser launch, including its browser profile, managed browser profile, provider binding, and launch policy.
_Avoid_: Browser config, launch profile

**Provider prompt**:
One requested model interaction routed through a provider binding, including its target, attachments, completion posture, and progress evidence.
_Avoid_: Browser prompt, request

**Materialization attempt**:
One bounded effort to turn a selected provider asset into a verified local artifact and durable receipt.
_Avoid_: Download attempt, materialization run

**Acceptance run**:
A bounded provider-specific verification workflow that produces operator-readable evidence about an Aura-Call behavior.
_Avoid_: Smoke, acceptance script

**Viewer download control**:
A download action outside the conversation-turn cards, used after a selected artifact opens its preview. Generic inline `Download file` labels do not establish viewer authority.

**Artifact cache reuse**:
A local conversation attachment matching a currently discovered artifact ID, filename and URI. Readability, size and any retained checksum are checked before reuse. New transfer budget excludes reused artifacts; explicit force bypasses reuse. Context refresh alone does not force transfer. A requested fresh context read must succeed before artifact materialization; provider failure cannot silently authorize cached download controls. Explicit refresh=false can use cached context.

**Provider session custody**:
A retained browser session must have a reachable caller owner. A proof-only read closes a session created on its private options; it preserves a session supplied by the caller. Deadline-scoped conversation reads and explicit-target utility wrappers return retained-session custody to their session-enabled caller.

**Provider response activity**:
The observed running response or pending tool approval on a provider page. This can differ from lease effect state after an external/CDP submission. TTL cleanup must not infer provider inactivity from a settled lease; active or unknown ChatGPT activity preserves its tab.
**AuraCall remote-view client**:
An operator-facing application view dedicated to AuraCall's owned desktops and managed browsers.
_Avoid_: Root desktop, source browser profile

**Root desktop display**:
The general desktop view available independently of the AuraCall remote-view client.
_Avoid_: AuraCall remote-view client

**AuraCall desktop**:
A named desktop owned by AuraCall and used to display its managed browsers.
_Avoid_: Browser profile, AuraCall runtime profile

**Control handoff**:
An explicit transfer of interaction ownership between automation and a human operator.
_Avoid_: View selection, browser launch

**Memory routing**:
The selection of a reviewed Graphiti group and audience for qualified source-backed memory. AuraCall uses `auracall_main`. Unresolved routing is distinct from a verified memory-service failure.
